# FeniCS Finite Element Method Implementation



## Description

This work simulates the temporal evolution of concentration in a pulsed electrodialysis system, employing the Nernst-Planck equation and Fick's law. The code consists of two main parts. Firstly, there is the implementation that simulates the concentration of NaCl whitin the pulsed electrodialysis system. And secondly, the implementation of a double diffusion model that simulates the behavior of the concentration of NaCl and SDS within the pulsed electrodialysis system.
